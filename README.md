# retro-calculator

This was the first project I ever worked on. 

I didn't know how to make the lcd-like numbers as images, and there were no free fonts that look like that, so I wrote a script to auto generate the html needed for the display, since it was essentially hundreds of lines of boilerplate only differing by indices. (I didn't know about ReactJS at the time) Then I created a quick little graphical tool to generate the bitmap codes for each character by clicking on the appropriate pixels, and added these to my JavaScript. 

Unfortunately I lost the code for the bitmap generating GUI tool.
